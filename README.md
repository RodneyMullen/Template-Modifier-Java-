Template Modifier


Template Modifier is an application designed to create a new file from a template and writing substituted values for chosen fields into the new file.   The name of the new file would be the substituted value for the first field.



Background to the Program:

Template Modifier works with Profiles, allowing multiple choices of templates, fields and locations of the templates to be saved.  This will allow the user to load any profile they wish.   Labels for fields can also be chosen in the create and edit screen.  If no labels are given then the labels will automatically be set to the field name.

On the main screen, values are entered in the Fields.  Press Go and the new Text document will be placed in your chosen directory.   All values entered at this stage will be "trimed", which means any blank space at the start or beginning of the entered value will be removed. All of the values entered will be substituted into the new file in the place of the fields where they were in the Template File. Confirmation of this will show a green light.  If you wish to continue with new values, then hit the clear all button.   If the Go button is pressed, any fields not entered will create the new file and blank out the original fields from the template.  If the Main Field is blanked out then the new file will be named "null.txt".

The Template Location and the Directory destination can be saved to the profile.

Saving Field Values:  
Template Modifier gives the option to save field values to the profile.  On the main screen, type in the item you wish to have saved in the specified field.  Tick the box and from now on anytime you load that profile, the saved value will already exist in the given field.  Any items in the chosen field will be replaced in the new file with the saved substituted value.  To remove or edit the saved values, just un tick the box.   The clear All button will not effect saved values.  

Load Profile:  Select any of the current profiles in the Load Profile submenu to load any profile you wish.

Default Profile
You may choose which profile you wish the program to automatically load each time you start up. You may do this by selecting a profile name in the set Default profile submenu in the Main menu.  the first profile in the menu is the default profile.  This will change as you choose different profiles as the default.

Creating a New Profile:
You can customise a new profile by selecting the Create new Profile in the Main menu.  You will be given a Text field in which to enter new fields.  The first entry will be the name of the profile, the second will be the main field whose substitution will be the name of the new file created e.g. if the field name is [hostname].  Any values you type in for this field such as JoeBloggs will be set as the new file JoeBloggs.txt with the substituted values from the Template file.

The following can only be accessed when you have selected the individual profile:

Editing a Profile
This item is in the Options menu. The user is given a list of the current fields with tick boxes.  If you wish to remove any of these fields then you may untick the accompanying box.  The Text Area in the centre of the window will show any updates to the profile as they occur.  You may also add in new fields in the provided Text Field.  Editing a profile will not delete previous saved values.

By pressing the next stage button you go to a screen with all the updated fields and the old ones you wish to keep in this profile.  You may now choose which field whose substitution you wish to be the name of the new text document or the Main Field.  Select any one of the fields to do this and hit done. The profile will be updated and you will return to the normal screen

Delete Profile:  when you delete a profile you cannot recover any saved data for this Profile. 

Rename Profile:  you can keep all the fields but only change the name of the profile.

Copy Profile:  You may make a copy of any profile.  The program will prompt you to enter a profile name.  A new profile will then be created just like the previous except with a different name.
